```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load data

## Shiny app

Add your shiny app below in a code chunk. In the `shinyApp()` function at the end of the app code,
specify a `height` option that is large enough for your app, e.g.

```
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(height = 500))
```
